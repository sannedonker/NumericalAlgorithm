We suspect that this difference comes from rounding errors 'earlier' in the number when summating with single precision. When we look at the run-time of these algorithms, we see that b is faster than a. This means that the usage of a single-precision accumulator instead of a double-precision accumulator decreases the cost of the algorithm.  \n",

    "In c, d and e, the Kahan summation algorithm was implemented. When we compare the results of c, d and e with b, we see that the implementation of the Kahan summation algorithm increases accuracy. We suspect that this algorithm works by recovering the lost low-order digits when adding a small and a large floating point number to each other: when an element $x_i$ is added to the total sum $t$, the lost low-order digits are stored in $c$, and added to the element $x_i$ in the next round. This way, these lost digits stay in the summation. \n",

Ordering in increasing order would be helpful when the range in size of the elements is large. This is because the accumulated sum over a large number of small elements will be of the same order as a larger element that will be added later to the sum. This will result in a smaller number of lost low-order digits, as discussed above. In this case, however, the algorithm is used to sum over a large number of elements with small and similar values. This means that the sum will rapidly be larger than the individual elements, and the low-order digits of the elements will be lost anyway. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since you have to order the numbers, methods d and e are more costly than method c, and since you perform more operations in these three methods they are all more costly than method a and b. Thus if we order the cost decreasingly we get: (d or e), c, a, b."
